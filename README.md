## 2018 Advent of Code

We have saved this one for a long time!

Let's use it as an opportunity to develop strategies for solving problems as fast as possible.

Seems like some workflow of exposing each program to accept command line args makes sense.
Then we can make it just take what we have on clipboard as input, somehow.

NOTE: I think we're not supposed to share inputs on github
